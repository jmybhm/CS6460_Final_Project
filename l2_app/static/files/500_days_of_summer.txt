          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a
          park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says
          a word.
          
          
          CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No
          words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants
          to be looked at.
          
          A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us.

                    This is a story of boy meets girl.

          INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          The boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular
          conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up
          sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t-
          shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to
          balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.

                    The boy, Tom Hansen of Margate, New
                    Jersey, grew up believing that he'd
                    never truly be happy until the day
                    he met his... "soulmate."

          INT LIVING ROOM - 1989
          
          PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His
          walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV,
          we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!"
